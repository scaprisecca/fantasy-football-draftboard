Allen had five #1 overall weekly finishes, that’s more than Herbert, Brady, Mahomes, Rodgers, Stafford, and Dak… combined. While his six rushing TDs were the lowest of his career, his dual-threat ability and the fact he always has week-winning upside makes him bullet-proof in both dynasty and redraft leagues moving forward. Allen struggled at home comparatively completing just 59.8 % of his passes and averaging 6.1 yards per attempt, the same number Zach Wilson averaged on the year. The guys seem to be in agreement that he should be drafted as the QB1 in 2022, especially with this sustained level of excellence."

Here are the players to throw for 5,000+ in a season before turning 24: Patrick Mahomes, Dan Marino, Matthew Stafford, & Herbert.

The Chiefs’ defensive improvement was a big part of the story as KC allowed only 16.1 points per game from Week 8 on. He still was a QB1 each of the final five weeks of the season.

He was effective throwing the deep ball, tying Tom Brady for most 20+ yard completions (35), and completing a league-leading 49.3 of those attempts. He improved his overall completion rate, TD rate, yards per attempt, and passing yards per game but dropped to fewer than FIVE rushing attempts per game. If Kyler doesn’t run, his fantasy ceiling ultimately is capped. Heading into 2022, the Cardinals have a ton of question marks with Hopkins’ suspension so he might fall to a spot in your drafts where the value is there."

In just his 2nd year in the league, he led the NFL in completion % (70.4), Yards per Pass Attempt (8.9) & 20+ Yard TDs (13). If there were any red flags, it’s the fact he led the NFL in sacks taken (51) including five games of 5+ sacks taken, most in a season over the last decade. He also bullied bottom-16 defenses with the largest split of fantasy points  (11.28) among top-10 QBs. While a TD rate more than doubling (3.2 to 6.5) usually is a sign of regression, he might be an outlier. His upside is immense as 5,000 passing yards & 40 TDs aren’t out of the question."

We only saw him in two brief starts but he managed to run the ball 24 combined times for 120 rushing yards which just shows you the type of upside you're looking for.

Even with 4,800+ passing yards and finishing 2nd among all QBs in 20+ yard pass plays last season, his lack of rushing yards ultimately hurts him from hanging with the elites for fantasy. The Raiders also were quite fortunate in 2021 going 10-7 despite having a win expectation of just 6.9. In the ultra-competitive AFC West, things only might get tougher in 2022.

While the Dolphins had the 8th most pass attempts in the NFL, the lack of efficiency and averaging only 204 passing yards per game is not going to cut it.

For fantasy, it’s kind of like Bill Belichick treats him like a Honda Civic. Dependable? Yes. Are you ever going to win a street race? No, unless it’s totally tricked out. The Patriots' game plan is winning with ball control and defense as Jones averaged only 223.6 passing yards per game finishing as a QB1 only five times.

In Washington, Wentz is now on his 3rd life with a new cast of pass-catchers. One drive he can look like an All-Pro and the next you’re wondering if maybe he knows which sport he’s playing out there.

He completed just 55(!) percent of his passes and led all QBs in sacks where the “QB was responsible”, not the offensive line. At the end of the year, he did show some flashes of brilliance including some rushing prowess which definitely entices fantasy managers. The Jets had a great NFL draft including taking Garrett Wilson at 10th overall to pair with Elijah Moore as one of the best young pass-catching duos in the NFL. Wilson has the tools but there are still major questions about whether he can take the leap for fantasy and be consistent enough to count on. Streamer? Yes. Will he turn into a weekly starter? Likely no."

Some of the inefficiency might come to the surface in complaints but an offense led by Big Ben and the Steelers' offensive line wasn’t helpful. Harris had the 2nd lowest yards per carry (3.91) ever among rookie RBs with 1,200+ rushing yards. The lowest? The aforementioned LaDainian Tomlinson at 3.65. He was fine and Najee will be too moving forward. The opportunity was glorious but there are a few red flags heading into 2022.

If there is another area of concern, it's the fact that during his last three full years as the Texans' starting QB, Watson targeted the RB position 14.7 percent of the time, dead last in the NFL.

This offense should revert to being top-5 in rush rate in 2022 making Dobbins's current 5th round ADP a possible value IF he can return to form. There's a chance Dobbins won't be ready for Week 1, but given that Gus Edwards if further behind Dobbins in his ACL recovery and the team only brought in declining or middling talent (shout out to Mike Davis), this should be Dobbins' job once healthy.

From that point on, Gibson saw five targets per game. Overall, he still tied with Joe Mixon for 2nd most 1st downs among all RBs. But the TDs were the major story. In 2020, he had a TD every 15 carries; in 2021, that regressed to every 37 carries. Gibson's preseason and training camp thus far has left his fantasy value hanging in the balance.

The 49ers also surprisingly selected RB Tyrion Davis-Price in the 3rd round to add to any already nauseous backfield rotation.

Never forget his Week 16 explosion against the Chargers where he ran for 149 yards and two scores in the Texans' shocking win. He's quickly going to be supplanted by rookie Dameon Pierce but the story of this geriatric jitterbug on the football field is one we are still all about. Just don't draft him though.

They were extremely run-heavy down the stretch but opened the year as one of the most pass-centric offenses in football. A.J. Brown’s arrival and monstrous contract will certainly make it more difficult for Smith to earn the target share he saw as a rookie. The real question here is whether or not Hurts can support two viable fantasy WRs."

If he can see more targets this year, Toney has a chance to post some ceiling performances, but of course, the floor is quite low after what we saw last year."

His 830 receiving yards were a career high and ranked 5th among all TEs last season, and what's most impressive about this is that he's the only TE who saw less than 75 targets to eclipse 700 receiving yards a year ago. Not surprisingly, his 2.33 yards per route run was an elite metric and ranked #1 among all TEs. Goedert is a proven pass catcher, but the addition of A.J.

He could be streamable at some point if new HC Brian Daboll's offense clicks and Daniel Jones is somewhat competent. But for now, he's a name to monitor."
